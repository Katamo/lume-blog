# Changelog

<p>This page tracks advances on my brand new blog project. Taking the shape of a standard changelog I will track here; changes, bug fixes and added features for this project.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Every time I take a look at my HD dev folders I see a lot incomplete tools, rough ideas, sketchy applications, bare pocs...<br>
Side projects in my hands often turns in neverending, neverdelivered, endless pieces of code.</p>
<p>After reading a few articles and a couple of books on get things done, I'm on my way to kick out my leaning to abandon projects.<br>
I'll took a simple resolution:<br>
Start by building a blog, the MVP of a small and working piece of software, then commit myself to add small improvements, changes and new content with regularity.<br>
My main motivation is to deal against my tendency to leave projects unfinished, beat my procastination monster but specially enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>I will track the advances on the project in this page.</p>
<p>Let's see how far it goes.</p>
